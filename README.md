# Loquate client

This repository is a Java 3rd party APIs wrapper for APIs provided by [Loqate](https://www.loqate.com/) by [GBG](https://www.gbgplc.com/en/). 
Loqate was formerly known as Addressy.

# Usage

## Initialisation

Use one of the `com.lindar.loqate.LoqateClient#of` methods as an entry point for this library. You will at minimum need a `key`, 
which you will get when signing up for a Loqate account.

## Functionality

The client provides wrappers around address capture and email verification functionalities. For details on the requests and responses for these APIs, 
you can view the API documentation [here](https://www.loqate.com/resources/support/apis/).
